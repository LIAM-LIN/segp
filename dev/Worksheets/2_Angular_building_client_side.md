## Angular concepts

We are going to be using Angular for our client side rendering. Angular is a fantastically flexible and scalable framework for building web applications. 

## Angular CLI main files

### package.json
A configuration file that contains the metadata for your application. When there is a package.json file in the root directory of the project. In the example we will be building, our hosting provider (Heroku) will use the Node.js buildpack to deploy your application. 

### app.json
A manifest format for describing web apps. It declares environment variables, add-ons, and other information required to run an app on Heroku. It is required to create a “Deploy to Heroku” button.

### server.js

This file contains all the server-side code used to implement the REST API. The API is written in Node.js, using the Express framework and the MongoDB Node.js driver.

### /src directory
This folder contains all of the Angular client code for the project.


## Modules, components, events

Components are the main building block for Angular applications. Each component consists of: An HTML template that declares what renders on the page, A Typescript class that defines behavior, A CSS selector that defines how the component is used in a template, and optionally, CSS styles applied to the template.
