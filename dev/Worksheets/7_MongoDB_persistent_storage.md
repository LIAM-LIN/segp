# MongoDB and Storage

Now we have built our API, and our frontend, it's time to think about how we might manage the storage of data. NoSQL databases like MongoDB can be useful if your data requirements include scalability and flexibility because with Mongo it's really easy to initialise and use database structures. MongoDB also works asynchronously with JSON objects so the design of our API so far will fit well. There is no reason why you couldn't deploy SQL (or SQLlite) at this stage if you would prefer; and this would also be a good way to practice your MariaDB knowledge. *However*, MongoDB will take less time to impliment, and will offer similar (if not better) performance for the kinds of tasks and operations we are doing.
