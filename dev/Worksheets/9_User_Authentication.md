# User Auth

To perfonalise the experience your Application users have, and to ensure the security of their data, we must impliment some kind of user authentication. At this point an application can really take off as you can provide completely unique experiences and render content based on user determined data. 

There are a lot of third party services (Like Auth0 & Okta) that will handle user authentication for you. Using a third party authentication provider has many advantages but naturally you must pay to use these services. We will be implimenting a very basic form of authentication so you can use as 'proof of concept'; but there are good reasons why this area would need more work should you choose to launch your application publically.
