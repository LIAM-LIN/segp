## Design Brief: A Web App for “Serious Play”

The assignment for this unit is to design and build a web app that is based around the concept of “serious play”. By serious we mean something that addresses a real-world problem or raises the profile of a serious issue but using playful techniques to engage. This isn’t a free license to just make a game! Your system has to incorporate serious real world applications and it’s primary purpose is not entertainment. However, in contrast your application has to have elements of fun and play in it which capture and sustain user attention.

For example can create a web app that encourages children to brush their teeth whilst measuring progress over time? Or can you create a game for gorillas that gives a report of their eyesight? Or can you create an interactive social network game that educates and informs about social media addiction? 
Due to the fact that this is a significant piece of work, you will need to work in small teams in order to complete the assignment. This brief is designed to balance ambition with the challenge of technical implementation. The markers will expect to see a blend of low-fidelity / high concept design, coupled with the solid and significant implementation of certain key elements. The extent to which your team successfully achieves this balance will be reflected in the marks awarded for this assignment. Although you are not required to create a fully working system, each element that you do build and its relation to the other components of the system must be clearly explained and justified.

Due to the scale of this challenge, you are not required to fully implement all aspects of this application - you must develop your idea to a level that would be presentable as a proof-of-concept prototype to potential investors. Each week we will be covering the technical development alongside the design development of your project.
